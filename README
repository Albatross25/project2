Run

$ ./webcrawler [username] [password]
====================================================================================
Approach

0. send HTTP GET request to Facebook
1. using regular expressions, get cookies: crsftoken and session ID
2. Send HTTP POST request with username and password(passed as arguments)and cookies
3. If login successful, parse the session ID using regular expression
4. visit all the urls stored in url list using GET request(first url stored in url
   list is the homepage)After opening a url, the url is put in a list
   which contains visited urls.
5. HTMLParser is used to find all urls link in every html page and the secret flags. 
   If a url is in visited list or in to visit url list, the url is dropped.If secret
   flag found,its appended to the secret flags list.
6. When urls is empty or 5 secret flags collected,socket connection is closed.
7. Handle exception: After sending HTTP GET request, the response is parsed to check
   HTTP status code.
   - if the status code is 200,continue crawling
   - if the status code is 301, parse the response message and get redirect
       url and insert the new url to urls
   - if the status is 403 or 404, abandon this url by just putting it into
       visited list
   - if the status is 500, re-try to send the request till open it successfully. 
     After reconnecting,the url is removed from visited list, and inserted to 
     the first position of urls. And the crawling continues till the loop 
	 condition is satisfied.

Challenges

1.Logging in to Fakebook, to get the right attributes to be sent in the POST
Request
2. 500 server response error handling

======================================================================================
Testing the code

1.The code was tested when server is not available, error message is printed.
2. Code was tested for two users, secret keys was fetched for both users.
3. Tested all exception handlers, which was raised on the status code from the server
